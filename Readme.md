# 🔖 Performance In React

<p>
  Performing concepts being applicated in React Web Applications to prevent multiples reloadings in components that don't need it. This can affect the application performance and user experience, because of that it is necessary sometimes to apply some concepts that React Library can provide to developers work with quality and performance in your web applications development.

  Big libraries was tested and applicated in this application to see their impact along the development and testing phase. With this tests was possible to detect the impact of each dependency installed, also what was necessary to improve the application performance.
